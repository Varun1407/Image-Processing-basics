**Canny Edge Detector:** 
Canny edge detection is a technique to extract useful structural information from different vision objects and dramatically reduce the amount of data to be processed. It has been widely applied in various computer vision systems. Canny has found that the requirements for the application of edge detection on diverse vision systems are relatively similar.

**Contour Detection:**
Contours detection is a process can be explained simply as a curve joining all the continuous points (along with the boundary), having same colour or intensity. The contours are a useful tool for shape analysis and object detection and recognition.

**Finding Edges with custom kernels:**
In this section I use a custom kernel to test the quality of edge detection. i.e., Sobel Filter.
The Sobel filter is very commonly used in edge detection and in finding patterns in intensity in an image. Applying a Sobel filter to an image is a way of taking (an approximation) of the derivative of the image in the x or y direction, separately.
